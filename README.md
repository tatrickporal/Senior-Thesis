This document discusses a design approach, entitled Mediator Pattern, for a experiment software user interfaces. We will describe a technology named Polymer used to implement the pattern within the context of a web application as well as detail its data flow of communication with the web browser. This paper will then focus on an implementation of this design approach on an economic experiment software featuring real time data visualization and web socket communication. The software highlighted supports research of High Frequency Trading (HFT) in multiple financial exchanges and market environments within the LEEPS Lab at University of California, Santa Cruz.
